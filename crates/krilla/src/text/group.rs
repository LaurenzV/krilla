/// In PDF, correspondences between glyphs and Unicode codepoints are expressed
/// via a CMAP. In a CMAP, you can assign a sequence of Unicode codepoints to each
/// glyph. There are two issues with this approach:
/// - How to deal with the fact that the same glyph might be assigned two different codepoints
///   in different contexts (i.e. space and NZWJ).
/// - How to deal with complex shaping scenarios, where there is not a one-to-one or
///   one-to-many correspondence between glyphs and codepoints, but instead a many-to-one
///   or many-to-many mapping.
///
/// The answer to this is the `ActualText` feature of PDF, which allows to define some custom
/// actual text for a number of glyphs, which overrides anything else. Unfortunately, this
/// is seemingly only supported in Acrobat and Chrome, but it's the only proper way of addressing
/// this issue.
///
/// This is the task of the `TextSpanner`. Given a sequence of glyphs, it segments the
/// sequence into subruns of glyphs that either do need to be wrapped in an actual text
/// attribute, or not.
