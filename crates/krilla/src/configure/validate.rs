//! Exporting with a specific PDF conformance level.
//!
//! PDF defines a number of additional conformance levels that restrict the features of PDF that
//! can be used to a specific subset.
//!
//! You can use a [`Validator`] by creating a corresponding [`Configuration`]
//! you want to build the document with. There are three important aspects that play into this:
//! - krilla will internally write the file in a way that conforms to the given standard, i.e.
//!   by settings appropriate metadata. This happens under-the-hood and is completely abstracted
//!   away from the user.
//! - For aspects that are out of control of krilla and dependent on the input, krilla will perform
//!   a validation that the input is compatible with the standard. krilla will record all violations,
//!   and when calling `document.finish()`, in case there is at least one violation, krilla will
//!   return them as an error, instead of returning the finished document. See [`ValidationError`].
//! - Finally, some standards have requirements that cannot possibly be validated by krilla, as
//!   they are semantic in nature. It is upon you, as a user of that library, to ensure that those
//!   requirements are fulfilled. Therefore, while krilla tries to make it as easy as possible
//!   to generate compliant PDFs, it is still highly recommended that you familiarize yourself
//!   with the PDF specification as well as the specifications for the substandards. This is
//!   especially true for standards related to universal accessibility.
//!   
//!  You can find some requirements below **Requirements** for each [`Validator`].
//!

    /// **Requirements**:
    ///
    /// General:
    /// - All real content should be tagged accordingly.
    /// - All artifacts should be marked accordingly.
    /// - The tag tree should reflect the logical reading order of the
    ///   document.
    /// - Information should not be conveyed by contrast, color, format
    ///   or layout.
    /// - All "best practice" notes in [`TagKind`] need to be complied with.
    ///
    /// Text:
    /// - You should make use of the `Alt`, `ActualText`, `Lang` and `Expansion` attributes
    ///   whenever possible.
    /// - Usually, you can provide an empty string as `Lang` to indicate that a language is unknown.
    ///   You should not do that in PDF/UA.
    /// - Stretchable characters (such as brackets, which often consist of several glyphs)
    ///   should be marked accordingly with `ActualText`.
    ///
    ///  Graphics:
    /// - Graphics should be tagged as figures (unless they are an artifact).
    /// - Graphics need to be followed by a caption.
    /// - Graphics that possess semantic values only in combination with other graphics
    ///   should be tagged with a single Figure tag for each figure.
    /// - If a more accessible representation exists, it should be used over graphics.
    ///
    /// Headings:
    /// - Headings should be tagged as such.
    /// - For not strongly structured documents, H1 should be the first
    ///   heading.
    ///
    /// Tables:
    /// - Tables should include headers and be tagged accordingly.
    /// - Tables should only be used to represent content within logical row/column relationship.
    ///
    /// Lists:
    /// - List items should be tagged with Li tags, if necessary also with
    ///   Lbl and LBody tags.
    /// - Lists should only be used when the content is intended to be read
    ///   as a list.
    ///
    /// Mathematical expressions:
    /// - All mathematical expressions should be enclosed with
    ///   a `Formula` tag.
    ///
    /// Headers and footers:
    /// - Headers and footers should be marked as corresponding
    ///   artifacts.
    ///
    /// Notes and references:
    /// - Footnotes, endnotes, note labels and references should be
    ///   tagged accordingly and use tagged annotations.
    /// - Footnotes and end notes should use the `Note` tag.
    ///
    /// Navigation:
    /// - The document must contain an outline, and it should reflect
    ///   the reading order of the document.
    /// - Page labels should be semantically appropriate.
    ///
    /// Annotations:
    /// - Annotations should be present in the tag tree in the correct
    ///   reading order.
    ///
    /// Fonts:
    /// - You should only use fonts that are legally embeddable in a file for unlimited,
    ///   universal rendering.
