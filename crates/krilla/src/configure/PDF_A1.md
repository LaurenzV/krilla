# Description
PDF/A-1 requires PDF version <= 1.4 and defines two conformance levels,
in the following order from less strict to more strict:
- Level B
- Level A

Level B is a subset of level A.

See `README.md` for the meaning of each color.

# Level B

6.1.5: krilla ensures that the document information dictionary is consistent with
the XMP metadata. 🟢

with an even number of characters and without whitespaces. 🟢

- krilla does not round close real numbers to 0. 🟠 
- krilla does not write at most 5 decimal places for real numbers. 🟠
- krilla always uses the `new_str` and `new_text_str` methods of the SerializeContext to create them, 
  which returns a validation error in case it's too long. 🔵

## 6.2 Graphics

6.2.2:
- krilla always writes a valid output intent. 🟢
- krilla always only writes one output intent. 🟢

6.2.3.1: krilla overrides the `no_device_cs` property if PDF/A is selected, and
in case CMYK is used but no profile was provided, export fails. 🟢

6.2.3.2: 
- sRGB/sGrey ICC profiles conform to ICC v2 specification. 🟢

6.2.4.3: 
- krilla always uses sRGB for RGB, and in addition also embeds an sRGB output intent. 🟢

  is required), and in addition always embeds an output intent. 🟢

  It fails export if no CMYK ICC profile was provided. 🟢

  in the applicable clauses 🟢

We only use PostScript functions. In any case, to be on the safe side, krilla fails exports
when a PostScript function is used. 🟢

6.2.9: krilla does never define a rendering intent. 🔵
