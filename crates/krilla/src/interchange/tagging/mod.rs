//! Creating accessible PDF documents.
//!
//! # Introduction
//!
//! A document usually consists of many smaller semantic building blocks, like for example
//! titles, headings, paragraphs, tables, headers, footers, and so on. However, it is important
//! to understand that, by default, when exporting a document to PDF, all of this semantic
//! information is lost.
//!
//! By default, a PDF document doesn't have a notion of a table or a
//! paragraph. Instead, it consists of very low-level instructions, such as "draw
//! a path at that location" or "draw a line of glyphs at that font size". A table is
//! not encoded as a "table", but instead as a number of rectangle-like paths that happen
//! to surround lines of text. This is what made PDF popular in the first place, as encoding
//! information at such a low level allows to ensure a consistent viewing experience across
//! different platforms and viewers.
//!
//! However, this design has drawbacks, one of the main ones being that it leads to the
//! production of non-accessible documents. Especially in recent years, ensuring the
//! accessibility of documents has become an increasingly important requirement.
//! To address this deficiency, PDF introduced the notion of "tagged PDF", which consists
//! of enriching PDF documents with additional semantic information in a way that can be
//! interpreted by different consumers. krilla supports the creation of such documents.
//!
//! # A word on krilla's implementation
//!
//! As nearly everything in PDF, tagging is a really complex topic, and getting it right
//! is very hard. Because of this, in line with the general philosophy of krilla, some
//! of the potential capabilities of tagged PDF are not directly supported. Instead, only
//! a specific subset has been implemented, with a focus on features that improve the
//! accessibility of documents.
//!
//! Please note that doing tagging 100% correctly as recommended by various PDF standards is very
//! difficult. While the documentation lists many of the recommendations to abstract away
//! as much as possible, users are still expected to consult the given specifications to
//! ensure their implementation matches the specification. A "reference implementation" that
//! could be good to consult is the [`typst-pdf`](https://github.com/typst/typst/tree/main/crates/typst-pdf)
//! crate which implements most of the expected features for well-tagged PDFs.
//!
//! # Basic Principles
//!
//! The way tagged PDFs are created is by attaching a tag tree to the PDF document
//! that encodes the logical structure of the document. As mentioned above, a raw PDF file
//! mainly consists of text- and path-drawing primitives, which are not necessarily
//! drawn in the logical reading order of the document. What the tag tree does is
//! maping the different "snippets" of the PDF file to the tree-like structure in a way
//! that reflects the logical structure of the document, in reading-order.
//!
//! For example, a document can consist of multiple "sections", where each section might contain
//! headings, paragraphs or figures. A figure might consist of a table as well as a caption.
//! A table consists yet again of smaller semantic components, like a header, footer
//! and the data cells, which usually contain some text. These kinds of hierarchical structures
//! can be encoded with the help of tagging.
//!
//! A tag tree consists of two components:
//! - Group nodes, which represents a component with certain semantics. A group node must have
//!   at least one child, otherwise it's discarded.
//! - Leaf nodes, which represent the actual pieces on the page that form part of a group.
//!
//! # How to create a tagged document
//!
//! If you want to create a tagged document, you need to follow the following steps:
//!
//! 1) Ensure that you activate the `enable_tagging` attribute in [`SerializeSettings`].
//! 2) Create a [tag tree](TagTree), which represents the "root" of a tag tree.
//! 3) As you create your document, create new [tag groups](TagGroup) with corresponding [tags](Tag).
//!    Nest them with other tag groups, if necessary, by using the `push` method.
//! 4) Populate tag groups with [identifiers](Identifier), which represent the leaf nodes
//!    in the tag tree. Identifiers are unique and point to a sequence of content on the
//!    page. If you push an identifier to a tag group, then all content that is marked by
//!    that identifier belongs semantically to that tag group. There are currently two ways
//!    of obtaining an identifier:
//!
//!    - Use the `add_tagged_annotation` method on [`Page`], which allows you to associate
//!      annotations to the content they correspond to. Currently, krilla only supports link
//!      annotations, and a link annotation should always be a child in a tag group with the
//!      [`TagKind`] [`Link`](TagKind::Link), with its sibling being an identifier or another tag group that is
//!      to be associated with the link.
//!    - Use the `start_tagged` command on [`Surface`], which returns an [Identifier], and
//!      indicates that all content drawn on the surface should be associated with that
//!      identifier, until you call the `end_tagged` method. *Important*: Note that you cannot
//!      nest calls to `start_tagged`, and you have to ensure that you always call a corresponding
//!      `end_tagged`. Otherwise, krilla will panic.
//!
//!      It is very important that each identifier you create has exactly one parent in the tag
//!      tree. This means that you cannot create an identifier and not use it at all (0 parents),
//!      or use the same identifier in two different parts of the tree (1+ parents). Otherwise,
//!      export will fail.
//!
//! 5) Once you have built your tag tree, simply call `set_tag_tree` on [`Document`]. That's it!
//!
//! # Other notes
//!
//! Make sure that you carefully read the documentation of the other parts of this module, as
//! there are some more points as well as best practices you need to keep in mind
//! when creating well-tagged documents. The PDF specification is in some places very vague
//! on how a tagged document should look like, so there is quite a bit of ambiguity.
//!
//! Apart from that, the PDF specification does make a few statements on requirements a well-tagged PDF
//! should follows, although  those are not really "strict" requirements in the sense that they can
//! be automatically checked by a PDF validator, so not conforming to some of those points does not
//! suddenly make your document a badly-tagged document! However, if possible, you should still
//! try to comply with the following requirements:
//!
//! - In general, all contents in your file should be tagged, either as an artifact or with
//!   Span/Other.
//! - The order of elements in the tag tree should represent the logical reading order, including
//!   annotations.
//! - Word breaks in text should be represented explicitly with spaces, instead of implicitly
//!   by not including them, but instead positioning text in a way that "simulates" the spaces.
//! - Hyphenation should be represented as a soft hyphen character (U+00AD) instead
//!   of a hard hyphen (U+002D).
//! - Tag groups should follow the best-practice of what kind of children they contain. See
//!   [`TagKind`] for more information.
//! - You should provide "Alt" descriptions for formulas and images.
//! - In case you have a link annotation that applies to text that wraps into one or multiple
//!   new lines, you should use the `quad_points` functionality to indicate the exact covered
//!   areas of the link.
//!
//! Once again, the above is only a best-effort summary, if you are interested in creating
//! completely well-tagged PDFs, you are advised to consult the given specifications.
