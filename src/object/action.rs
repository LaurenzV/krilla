//! PDF actions, allowing you to add interactivity to the document.
//!
//! PDF has the concept of "actions", which encompass things like navigating to a URL,
//! opening some file on the system, and so on. The PDF reference defines a whole bunch
//! of actions, but krilla does not expose nearly all of them, and never will. As of right now,
//! the only available action is the link action, which allows you to specify a link that
//! should be opened, when activating the action.
