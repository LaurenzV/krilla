//! Drawing to a non-page context.
//!
//! In 90% of the cases, you will not have to use streams. In most cases,
//! all you need to do when using this crate is to first construct a document,
//! and then add new pages to the document and use the [`Page::surface`] method to get
//! access to the drawing context. However, there are cases when you don't want to
//! draw on the main page surface, but instead you want to create a "sub-surface"
//! where you can draw independently of the main page contents. This is what streams
//! are there for. Currently, there are only two situations where you need to do that:
//!
//! - When using masks and defining the contents of the mask.
//! - When using a pattern fill or stroke and defining the contents of the pattern.
//!
//! If you want to do any of the two above, you need to call the [`Surface::stream_builder`] method
//! of the current surface. The stream builder represents a kind of sub-context that is
//! independent of the main surface you are working with. Once you have a stream builder, you
//! can once again invoke the [`StreamBuilder::surface`] method, and use this new surface to define the contents
//! of your mask/pattern. In the end, you can call [`StreamBuilder::finish`] which will return a [`Stream`] object.
//! This [`Stream`] object contains the encoded instructions of the mask/pattern, which you can
//! then use to create new [`Pattern`]/[`Mask`] objects.
//!
//! [`Page::surface`]: crate::page::Page::surface
//! [`Surface::stream_builder`]: crate::surface::Surface::stream_builder
//! [`Pattern`]: crate::paint::Pattern
//! [`Mask`]: crate::mask::Mask
