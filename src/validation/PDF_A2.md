# Description
PDF-A/2 requires PDF a version <= 1.7 and defines three conformance levels, 
in the following order from less strict to more strict:
- Level B
- Level U
- Level A

Level U is a subset of level A, and level B is a subset of level U.

See `README.md` for the meaning of each color.

## Level B

## 6.1 File structure

6.1.2: `pdf-writer` always write the file header as described in the spec. Even if the
user enables `ascii_compatible`, we still write a binary header marker. 🟢

6.1.3: 
- We always set the file ID. 🟢
- We do not support encryption. 🔵

6.1.4: `pdf-writer` always write the xref section as described in the spec. 🟢

6.1.5: -

6.1.6: `pdf-writer` always writes hex strings with an even number of characters. 🟢

6.1.7: 
- `pdf-writer` always write streams as described in the spec. 🟢
- krilla does never write streams referencing external files. 🔵
- krilla does never use `LZWDecode` or `Crypt`. 🔵
- krilla never writes F, FFIlter or FDecodeParams in streams. 🔵

6.1.8: krilla only ever writes UTF-8 strings as names. 🟢

6.1.9: `pdf-writer` always writes indirect objects as described in the spec. 🟢

6.1.10: krilla does never use inline image dictionaries. 🔵

6.1.11: -

6.1.12: krilla doesn't support permissions. 🔵

6.1.13:
- `pdf-writer` uses i32 for integers. 🟢
- `pdf-writer` uses f32 for real numbers. 🟢
- krilla always uses the `new_str` and `new_text_str` methods of the SerializerContext to create them, 
  which returns a validation error in case it's too long. 🔵
- krilla trims the names of fonts, and all other names cannot be longer than 127. 🔵
- krilla fails export if more than 8388607 indirect objects exist. 🟢
- krilla fails export if a higher nesting-level than 28 exists. 🟢
- krilla does not use the DeviceN color space. 🟢
- krilla only uses u16 for CIDs. 🟢

## 6.2 Graphics

6.2.2:
- krilla doesn't use non-standard operators. 🟢
- krilla doesn't use the `ri` or `i` operator. 🟢
- krilla ensure that content stream has their own associated resource dictionary
(TODO: what about glyph streams in Type3 fonts?). 🟢

6.2.3: krilla always write an `sRGB` output intent for PDF/A. 🟢

6.2.4.1: krilla overrides the `no_device_cs` property if PDF/A is selected, and
in case CMYK is used but no profile was provided, export fails.

6.2.4.2: 
- sRGB/sGrey ICC profiles conform to ICC v4 specification. 🟢
- krilla does not support overprinting. 🔵

6.2.4.3: 
- krilla always uses sRGB for RGB, and in addition also embeds an sRGB output intent. 🟢
- krilla always uses sGrey (except for encoding the alpha channel in images, where DeviceGray
  is required), and in addition always embeds an output intent. 🟢
- krilla always uses an CMYK ICC profile, and always sets CMYK as the output intent. 🟢
  It fails export if no CMYK ICC profile was provided. 🟢

6.2.4.4: krilla does not support DeviceN/Separation color spaces. 🔵

6.2.4.5: Fulfilled because patterns are treated the same as all other elements in krilla. 🟢

6.2.5: krilla does not use the transfer functions, halftones, TR/HTP/RI/FL keys. 🔵

6.2.6: krilla does never define a rendering intent. 🔵

6.2.7: krilla is not a reader. 🔵

6.2.9.2: krilla does not use reference XObjects. 🔵

6.2.9.3: The spec only talks about PostScript XObjects, which we don't really use. 
We only use PostScript functions. In any case, to be on the safe side, krilla fails exports
when a PostScript function is used. 🟢

6.2.10: krilla always includes an OutputIntent for PDF/A, so the /G attribute is not
always required. 🟢

6.2.11.1: krilla fails export in PDF/A when the .notdef glyph is referenced. 🟢

6.2.11.2: krilla has made sure that the spec is followed in this regard. 🟢

6.2.11.3.1: krilla always uses `Identity-H` as encoding. 🟢

6.2.11.3.2: krilla always writes the `CIDToGidMap` entry. 🟢

6.2.11.3.3: krilla always writes the `WMode` entry for cmaps and never references any other ones. 🟢

6.2.11.4.1: 
- krilla always embeds the used fonts. 6.2.11.4.2:
- krilla does not verify the "legality" of the embedded font. 🟣

6.2.11.4.2: 
- krilla never writes the `CharSet` attribute. 🔵
- krilla always includes all CIDs in `CIDSet`. 🔵

6.2.11.5: krilla copies the font metrics directly from the font. 🟢

6.2.11.6:
- krilla embeds all fonts as symbolic. 🟢
- krilla does not write TrueType fonts directly. 🔵
- krilla only writes CIDFonts instead of TrueType fonts directly, so cmap is not needed. 🟢
